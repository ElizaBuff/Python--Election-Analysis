# Analysis of the Election Audit

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in Python and Visual Studio (VS) Code: create and add lists, create and add keys and values to a dictonary, use decision statements to check a condition, apply membership and logical operators to decision statements, use repetition statements to iterate through a list or dictionary. To accomplish these goals, I was given a fictional situation and data set of approximatelly 40 thousand rows of data.
